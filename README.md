This is what appears when the user types in a range of peoples names and there marks that they got in there exams,

This shows that the code will crash if you type in anything else other than numbers into when it askes you to type in the students name

This is the data i used ot determine what mark the students got compared to how many marks they got

Mark Range	Grade	Classification
70-100	A	First Class
60-69	B	Upper Second Class
50-59	C	Lower Second Class
40-49	D	Third Class
0-39	F	Fail

The program also calculates the average mark and percentage of the amount of marks each student got.

Improvements - Could include an actual interface for the user to have an easier way of using the code.
             - Maybe add a web browser extention to the app so the user could use it whenever without having to download the code onto there device 
             
Limitations - Once a students name is added it cant be taken out of the list
            - Once a mark is added to a students name it cant be edited
