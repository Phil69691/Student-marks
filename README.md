This is the data i used ot determine what mark the students got compared to how many marks they got

Mark Range	Grade	Classification
70-100	A	First Class
60-69	B	Upper Second Class
50-59	C	Lower Second Class
40-49	D	Third Class
0-39	F	Fail

The program also calculates the average mark and percentage of the amount of marks each student got.

Improvements - Could include an actual interface for the user to have an easier way of using the code.
             - Maybe add a web browser extention to the app so the user could use it whenever without having to download the code onto there device 
             
Limitations - Once a students name is added it cant be taken out of the list
            - Once a mark is added to a students name it cant be edited
